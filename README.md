## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

Food Rx is built with a modern stack, designed for scalability and a smooth user experience.

-   **Frontend**: Flutter
-   **State Management**: Provider
-   **Database**: MongoDB
-   **Food Data & Recipes**: Spoonacular API
-   **Chatbot**: Google Cloud Dialogflow
-   **Backend Automation**: Google Cloud Functions (for scheduled tasks like resetting trackers)

The project follows a **feature-first architecture**, where code is organized by feature (e.g., `auth`, `recipes`, `pantry`). This makes the codebase modular, easier to navigate, and simpler to maintain.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Food Rx project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   Flutter SDK (version >=3.0.0 <4.0.0)
-   An IDE (like VS Code or Android Studio) with the Flutter plugin.
-   Access to:
    -   A MongoDB database.
    -   A Spoonacular API key.
    -   A Google Cloud Platform project with Dialogflow CX enabled.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/jariwala-jay/food-rx-app.git](https://github.com/jariwala-jay/food-rx-app.git)
cd food-rx-app
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

The application uses a `.env` file to manage sensitive API keys and configuration.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
2.  Add the following configuration details. You will need to replace the placeholder values with your own keys.

    ```env
    # Spoonacular API Key for recipe and ingredient data
    SPOONACULAR_API_KEY="YOUR_SPOONACULAR_API_KEY"

    # MongoDB Connection String
    MONGODB_URL="mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-uri>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

    # Dialogflow Configuration
    DIALOGFLOW_PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"
    DIALOGFLOW_AGENT_ID="your-dialogflow-agent-id"
    DIALOGFLOW_LOCATION="global"
    DIALOGFLOW_LANGUAGE_CODE="en"
    ```

3.  **Dialogflow Service Account**: Place your Google Cloud service account JSON key file in `assets/dialogflow_auth.json`. This is required for the chatbot to authenticate with Google's services.

> **Note**: The `.env` file and `dialogflow_auth.json` are listed in `.gitignore` and should **never** be committed to your repository.

### 5. Run the Application

You can now run the app on a connected device or simulator:

```bash
flutter run
```
